This guide covers common issues and their solutions when using the Frigate LLM Notification automation.

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. No Notifications Received

#### Symptoms
- Automation triggers but no mobile notifications arrive
- Events show in logs but devices don't receive alerts

#### Troubleshooting Steps

**Check Mobile App Configuration**
```yaml
# Verify these settings on your mobile device:
1. Home Assistant Companion App installed and logged in
2. Notification permissions enabled
3. Battery optimization disabled for HA app
4. Background activity allowed
```

**Verify Device Selection**
```yaml
# In automation configuration, ensure:

2. Device names match Home Assistant device registry
3. Integration: mobile_app filter is working
```

**Test Basic Notifications**
```yaml
# Create test automation:
- action: notify.mobile_app_your_device
  data:
    title: "Test Notification"
    message: "This is a test from Home Assistant"
```

**Check Device Entity Names**
```yaml
# Find correct device names:
Developer Tools ‚Üí States ‚Üí Search for "mobile_app"
# Look for entities like: notify.mobile_app_johns_phone
```

#### Common Solutions
- **Restart mobile app** and re-enable notifications
- **Check Do Not Disturb** settings on mobile device
- **Verify network connectivity** between HA and mobile device
- **Update Companion App** to latest version

### 2. AI Analysis Not Working

#### Symptoms
- Notifications use fallback messages instead of AI descriptions
- "LLM Vision analysis failed" in logs
- Blank or error messages in notifications

#### Troubleshooting Steps

**Verify LLM Vision Integration**
```yaml
# Check integration status:
Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí LLM Vision
# Ensure status is "Connected" and no error messages
```

**Test AI Provider Connection**
```yaml
# Test with simple prompt:
Developer Tools ‚Üí Services
Service: llmvision.image_analyzer
Data:
  provider: your_provider
  model: your_model
  message: "Describe this image"
  image_url: "https://example.com/test-image.jpg"
```

**Check API Keys and Credits**
```yaml
# Verify:
1. API key is valid and not expired
2. Provider account has available credits/quota
3. Model name is correctly spelled
4. Provider service is operational
```

**Review Prompt Complexity**
```yaml
# Simplify prompt for testing:
Simple Test Prompt: "Describe what you see in this image in one sentence."

# Check for issues:
- Prompt too long (reduce complexity)
- Invalid template variables
- Special characters causing parsing errors
```

#### Common Solutions
- **Regenerate API keys** if authentication fails
- **Reduce prompt complexity** and token limits
- **Switch to different model** (e.g., gpt-4o-mini)
- **Check provider status pages** for service outages

### 3. File Download Errors

#### Symptoms
- "Failed to download image/clip" in logs
- Local file paths return 404 errors
- Automation stops at download step

#### Troubleshooting Steps

**Check Downloader Integration**
```yaml
# Verify downloader is configured:
configuration.yaml:
  downloader:
    download_dir: downloads  # or your custom path
```

**Verify Directory Permissions**
```yaml
# Check Home Assistant has write access:
# SSH or terminal access required
ls -la /config/downloads/
# Should show proper ownership and write permissions
```

**Test Download Manually**
```yaml
# Test download service:
Developer Tools ‚Üí Services
Service: downloader.download_file
Data:
  url: "http://your-ha-ip:8123/api/frigate/notifications/123/snapshot.jpg"
  filename: "test_snapshot.jpg"
```

**Verify Network Connectivity**
```yaml
# Check Home Assistant can reach itself:
# Test URL format: http://192.168.1.100:8123/api/frigate/...
# Ensure:
1. IP address is correct in automation config
2. Port 8123 is accessible
3. No firewall blocking internal requests
```

#### Common Solutions
- **Fix directory permissions**: `chmod 755 /config/downloads`
- **Create download directory**: `mkdir -p /config/downloads`
- **Update Home Assistant IP** in automation configuration
- **Check available disk space**

### 4. Frigate Event Detection Issues

#### Symptoms
- Automation never triggers despite camera motion
- Wrong objects/zones trigger automation
- Events trigger for excluded areas

#### Troubleshooting Steps

**Verify Frigate MQTT Events**
```yaml
# Monitor MQTT messages:
Developer Tools ‚Üí Events ‚Üí Listen to Events
Event Type: mqtt_message_received

# Or check MQTT directly:
Topic: frigate/reviews
```

**Check Camera Configuration**
```yaml
# Verify in automation:
1. Correct camera selected from dropdown
2. Camera name matches Frigate configuration
3. Zones are properly defined in Frigate
4. Object detection is working in Frigate
```

**Test Zone Logic**
```yaml
# Check zone configuration:
- All Zones: false (any zone triggers)
- All Zones: true (all zones must trigger)

# Verify zone names match Frigate configuration
```

**Review Object Detection**
```yaml
# In Frigate web interface:
1. Check camera feed shows detection boxes
2. Verify objects are being detected consistently
3. Check confidence thresholds in Frigate config
```

#### Common Solutions
- **Restart Frigate** to refresh MQTT connections
- **Check MQTT broker** connectivity
- **Review Frigate camera config** for proper zones/objects
- **Adjust detection sensitivity** in Frigate

### 5. Performance Issues
