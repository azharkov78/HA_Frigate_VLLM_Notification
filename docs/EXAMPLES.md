# Examples and Use Cases - Frigate LLM Notification

This document provides real-world configuration examples and use cases for the Frigate LLM Notification automation.

## üè† Home Security Use Cases

### 1. Front Door Visitor Detection

**Scenario**: Monitor front door for visitors, deliveries, and suspicious activity.

```yaml
# Configuration
Camera: camera.front_door
Zones: [front_porch, steps]
Objects: [person]
All Zones: false

# Snapshot Analysis
LLM Vision Snapshot: true
Prompt: |
  Analyze this front door security image. Focus on the person in the front porch area.
  Describe:
  1. Who appears to be at the door (delivery person, visitor, unknown individual)
  2. What they are carrying or doing
  3. Whether this appears to be normal visitor activity or requires attention
  4. Their apparent intent (delivering package, knocking, waiting, leaving)
  
  Rate the concern level as LOW (expected visitor/delivery), MEDIUM (unknown but normal behavior), 
  or HIGH (suspicious behavior) and explain why.

# Video Analysis  
Clip Prompt: |
  Track the person's complete interaction with the front door area.
  Describe the sequence of events: How they approached, what they did at the door,
  how long they stayed, and how they left. Note any packages delivered or picked up.
  Assess if this was a normal visitor interaction or if there are any concerns.

# Notification Settings
Click Action New Event: "{{image_local}}"
Click Action End Event: "{{video_local}}"
Cooldown: 3
```

**Expected Results**:
- "LOW concern: Delivery person in uniform placed package at front door and left"
- "MEDIUM concern: Unknown visitor knocked and waited 2 minutes before leaving"
- "HIGH concern: Individual approached door, looked around suspiciously, then left quickly without knocking"

### 2. Driveway Vehicle Monitoring

**Scenario**: Monitor driveway for family vehicles, deliveries, and unauthorized access.

  3. Any people getting in or out of the vehicle
  4. Suspicious behavior (slow driving, circling, parking without purpose)
  
  Classify as: FAMILY (known vehicle), DELIVERY (commercial vehicle/uniform), 
  VISITOR (normal guest), or CONCERN (suspicious activity).

# Video Analysis
Clip Prompt: |

## üí° Tips for Creating Custom Use Cases

### 1. Start Simple
- Begin with basic person detection
- Add complexity gradually
- Test each component before combining

### 2. Optimize Prompts
- Be specific about what you want to detect
- Include context about normal vs concerning behavior
- Use consistent terminology for classification

### 3. Plan Custom Actions
- Consider what should happen after detection
- Think about notification urgency levels
- Plan for integration with existing systems

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Balance detail with response time
- Use appropriate models for your use case
- Consider token limits and costs

### 5. Privacy and Ethics
- Ensure compliance with local privacy laws
- Consider notification to people being monitored
- Implement appropriate data retention policies

These examples provide a foundation for creating your own custom security and monitoring solutions. Adapt the configurations to match your specific environment, needs, and integration requirements.
