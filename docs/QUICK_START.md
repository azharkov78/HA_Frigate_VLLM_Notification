3. Camera and zones configured properly
4. MQTT broker working (check Frigate events)
```

### AI Analysis Not Working

1. LLM Vision integration configured
2. API key valid and has credits
3. Model selection correct
4. Prompt not too complex
```

### Files Not Downloading

## üé® Customization Tips

### Improve AI Descriptions
```yaml
# Better prompts:

```

### Optimize Performance
```yaml
# Fast models for real-time alerts:
- gpt-4o-mini
- gemini-1.5-flash
- claude-3-5-haiku-latest

# Limit tokens for speed:
Tokens: 50-100 for quick descriptions
Tokens: 100-200 for detailed analysis
```

### Reduce False Positives
```yaml
# Fine-tune zones:
- Create smaller, specific zones
- Exclude areas with frequent motion (trees, flags)
- Use object filtering (person only for doors)
```
