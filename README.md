- **Memory Integration**: Uses LLM Vision's memory and timeline features for enhanced context

### üì± Smart Notifications
- **Rich Mobile Notifications**: Includes images, videos, and actionable buttons
- **Customizable Click Actions**: Direct links to camera feeds, downloaded files, or dashboards
- **Multiple Device Support**: Send notifications to multiple mobile devices
- **Notification Grouping**: Organizes alerts by camera for better management

### üîß Advanced Configuration
- **Zone-Based Filtering**: Only alert for specific areas of interest
- **Object Detection**: Filter alerts by specific objects (person, car, etc.)
- **Sub-label Support**: Advanced filtering with Frigate sub-labels
- **Cooldown Periods**: Prevents notification spam
- **Custom Actions**: Run additional automations on events

### üìÅ Local File Management
- **Download Integration**: Stores Frigate files locally for improved reliability

## üìù Usage Examples

### Basic Security Monitoring
```yaml
# Configuration for basic person detection
Camera: camera.front_door
Zones: [front_porch, driveway]
Objects: [person]
AI Prompt: "Describe who is approaching the front door and what they appear to be doing."
```

### Advanced Vehicle Monitoring
```yaml
# Configuration for driveway vehicle detection
Camera: camera.driveway
Zones: [driveway, street]
Objects: [car, truck, motorcycle]
AI Prompt: "Analyze the vehicle activity. Is this a delivery, visitor, or potential security concern?"
```

### Multi-Zone Package Detection
```yaml
# Configuration for package delivery monitoring
Camera: camera.porch
Zones: [front_porch, steps]
Objects: [person, package]
AI Prompt: "Focus on package delivery activity. Describe if packages are being delivered or picked up."
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- **Model Selection**: Use faster models (gpt-4o-mini, gemini-1.5-flash) for real-time alerts
- **Token Limits**: Keep token counts reasonable (50-150) for faster responses
- **Frame Limits**: Limit video analysis to 3-5 frames for better performance

### Storage Management
- **Regular Cleanup**: Implement periodic cleanup of downloaded files
- **Directory Structure**: Use organized subdirectories by date or camera
- **Monitoring**: Track storage usage to prevent disk full issues

### Notification Strategy
- **Cooldown Periods**: Use 2-5 minute cooldowns to prevent spam
- **Zone Optimization**: Configure zones to reduce false positives
- **Device Grouping**: Group family devices for coordinated notifications

### AI Prompt Engineering
- **Be Specific**: Include relevant context about what you want to detect
- **Set Priorities**: Specify what events are most important
- **Include Context**: Mention zones, objects, and expected activities

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Notifications Not Received
- Verify Mobile App permissions for notifications
- Check device selection in automation configuration
- Ensure devices are online and connected

#### AI Analysis Failures
- Verify LLM Vision integration is properly configured
- Check API keys and provider status
- Review prompt complexity and token limits

#### File Download Errors
- Confirm Downloader integration is installed
- Verify directory permissions and available storage
- Check network connectivity to Frigate server

#### Event Detection Issues
- Review Frigate camera configuration and zones
- Check object detection settings and confidence levels
- Verify MQTT broker connectivity
